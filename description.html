                The resplendent quetzal is the largest trogon. It is 36 to 40 cm (14â€“16 in) long; in the nominate
                subspecies, the tail streamers measure between 31 cm (12 in) and 100.5 cm (39.6 in), with the median
                being 75 cm (30 in) for males. The nominate subspecies weighs about 210 g (7.4 oz), while the subspecies
                <em><i class="taxonomy subspecies" lang="la">costaricensis</i></em> is slightly smaller than the
                nominate race, with shorter wings and bills. The tail plumes are shorter and narrower, measuring between
                32 cm (13 in) and 86 cm (34 in), with the median being 63 cm (25 in).

                Resplendent quetzals have a green body (showing iridescence from green-gold to blue-violet) and a red
                lower breast and belly. Depending on the light, quetzal feathers can shine in a variant of colors: from
                green, cobalt, lime, and yellow to ultramarine. Their green upper tail coverts hide their tails and are
                particularly splendid in breeding males, being longer than the rest of the body. Though the quetzal's
                plumage appears green, they are actually brown due to the pigment melanin. The primary wing coverts are
                also unusually long and have a fringed appearance. The male has a helmet-like crest. The bill, which is
                partly covered by green filamentous feathers, is yellow in mature males and grey in females. Their
                iridescent feathers, which cause them to appear shiny and green like the canopy leaves, are a camouflage
                adaptation to hide within the canopy during rainy weather. The quetzal's skin is very thin and easily
                torn, so it has evolved thick plumage to protect its skin. It has large eyes, adapted to see in the dim
                light of the forest. Their song is an array of full-toned, mellow, slurred notes in plain patterns and
                is often remarkably melodious: <em>keow, kowee, keow, k'loo, keeloo.</em>
