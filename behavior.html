                    Resplendent quetzals generally display shy and quiet behaviour to elude predators. In contrast, they
                    are rather vocal during the mating season and their behavior is designated to exhibit and attract
                    mates. Their known predators include the ornate hawk-eagle, golden eagle, and other hawks and owls
                    as adults, along with emerald toucanets, brown jays, long-tailed weasels, squirrels, and kinkajous
                    as nestlings or eggs. The resplendent quetzal plays an important ecological role in the cloud
                    forests, helping disseminate the seeds of at least 32 tree species.

                    <p>
                        Resplendent quetzals are considered specialized fruit-eaters, feeding on 41 to 43 species, although
                        they also feed on insects (primarily wasps, ants, and larvae), frogs, lizards, and snails.
                        Particularly important are the <em><i lang="la">Symplococarpon purpusii</i></em> and wild avocados,
                        as well as other fruits of the laurel family, which the birds swallow whole before regurgitating the
                        pits, which helps to disperse these trees. Quetzals feed more frequently in the midday hours. The
                        adults eat a more fruit-based diet than the chicks, who eat insects primarily and some fruits. Over
                        fifty percent of the fruit they eat are laurels. Quetzals use the methods of "hovering" and
                        "stalling" in order to selectively pick the fruit from near the tips of the branches.

            <h2>Breeding</h2>
            <section id="behavior_breeding">
                <p>
                    Resplendent quetzals create their nests over 200 feet (60 m) up in the air and court in the air with
                    specific calls. Six specific vocal calls have been recorded: the two-note whistle, <em>gee-gee</em>,
                    <em>wahc-ah-wahc</em>, <em>wec-wec</em>, whistle, <em>coouee</em>, <em>uwac</em>, chatter, and
                    buzzing. The first call is related to male territorial behavior, while the <em>coouee</em> whistle
                    is a mating call. Resplendent quetzals usually live alone when not breeding. They are monogamous
                    territorial breeders, with the size of their territory in Guatemala being 6–10 ha (15–25 acres).
                    They are also seasonal breeders, with the breeding season lasting from March to April in Mexico, May
                    to June in El Salvador, and March to May in Guatemala. When breeding, females lay one to three pale
                    blue eggs with a mean of 38.9 millimetres (1.53 in) x 32.4 millimetres (1.28 in) in a nest placed in
                    a hole which they carve in a rotten tree. Resplendent quetzals tend to lay two clutches per year and
                    are known to have a high rate of nest failure, 67-78%. One of the most important factors when
                    choosing a nest location for the quetzal is that the tree must be in a stage of decomposition and
                    decay. They often reuse their previous sites. The height of nest stubs is 41 feet (10 m) and the
                    nest holes 31 feet (9 m).

                    Both parents take turns at incubating, with their long tail coverts folded forwards over out of the
                    hole, giving them the appearance of a bunch of fern growing out of the hole. The incubation period
                    lasts about 17 to 19 days,[1] during which the male generally incubates the eggs during the day
                    while the female incubates them at night.[28] When the eggs hatch, both parents take care of the
                    young, feeding them entire fruits, such as berries and avocados, as early as the second day.
                    However, chicks are primarily fed insects, lizards, snails and small frogs. It was observed that
                    males generally give more food, namely insects, than females. Nestlings are often neglected and even
                    abandoned by females near the end of the rearing period, leaving it up to the male to continue
                    caring for the offspring until they are ready to survive on their own. During the incubation period,
                    parents land and rotate their heads side to side before entering the nest, a process known as
                    "bowing in". This process ends when the chicks hatch. Young quetzals begin flying after a month, but
                    the distinctive long tail feathers can take three years to develop in males.
